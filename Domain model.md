##  Core Domain Entities

| **Entity**     | **Attributes**                                                                 | **Methods (Responsibilities)**                                               | **Relationships**                                                                 |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **User**       | `id`, `name`, `email`, `passwordHash`, `role`, `lastLogin`                     | `login()`, `logout()`, `updateProfile()`                                     | Superclass for: Learner, Educator, SystemAdmin, Developer                       |
| **Learner**    | `gradeLevel`, `submissions: List<Submission>`                                  | `submitAssessment()`, `editSubmission()`, `viewMarks()`, `chatWithEducator()`| Inherits from `User`; submits `Submission`s; receives `Notification`s           |
| **Educator**   | `assessments: List<Assessment>`, `reports: List<Report>`                        | `uploadAssessment()`, `markSubmission()`, `generateReport()`, `sendNotification()` | Inherits from `User`; creates `Assessment`s and `Report`s                       |
| **Assessment** | `id`, `title`, `instructions`, `deadline`, `educatorId`, `createdAt`           | `isDeadlinePassed()`, `notifyLearners()`                                     | Belongs to `Educator`; receives many `Submission`s                              |
| **Submission** | `id`, `learnerId`, `assessmentId`, `content`, `timestamp`, `status`, `marks`   | `verifyOTP()`, `updateStatus()`                                              | Belongs to `Assessment` and `Learner`; references `OTP`                         |
| **Report**     | `id`, `educatorId`, `criteria`, `generatedAt`, `reportData`                    | `generate()`, `download()`                                                   | Generated by `Educator`; includes performance data from `Submission`s           |
| **OTP**        | `code`, `userId`, `expiresAt`, `verified`                                      | `generate()`, `validate()`                                                   | Used by `Submission` and `User` for secure operations                           |
| **Notification** | `id`, `recipientId`, `message`, `timestamp`                                  | `send()`, `markAsRead()`                                                     | Sent to `User`; often created by `Educator` or system logic                     |

##  Relationships Overview

- `User` is an **abstract superclass** for `Learner`, `Educator`, etc.
- `Educator` **creates** many `Assessment`s and **generates** `Report`s.
- `Learner` **submits** `Submission`s for each `Assessment`.
- `Submission` **references** a valid `OTP` and belongs to both `Assessment` and `Learner`.
- `Notification`s are **sent to Users** (usually Learners).
- `Educators` and `Learners` **communicate via messaging** (future expansion).

---

##  Business Rules

1. **Learners must verify submissions using OTP** within the allowed time frame.
2. **Submissions cannot be accepted after the assessment deadline**.
3. **Editing submissions is only possible if allowed by the educator**.
4. **System administrators can delete users who are inactive for X days**.
5. **Educators generate reports using criteria (e.g., top 10 learners, averages)**.
6. **Updates to the system must occur during off-peak hours** and lock the interface.
7. **All passwords are hashed**, and **registration must use school domain emails**.
